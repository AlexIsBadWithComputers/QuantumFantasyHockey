    "In this notebook, we will go through how to perform a Markowitz style portfolio optimization using a D-Wave Quantum Annealer, as opposed to traditional Linear/Quadradic programming solvers. To begin, we first need to define our problem in terms of how it would work as a traditional constrained optimization problem, then how to re-write it as an \"unconstrained\" problem that can be translated as a Binary Quadratic Model (BQM) to be run on D-Wave quantum processors. \n",

The constraint equations above imply that we _must_ choose some number of players in each position, in this case the indexes $F,D$ and $G$ mean forwards, defence and goalies respectively. As well, we have a point values constraint as represented by $ \\sum_{x \\in T}C_i x_i = V $ where $T$ is the team we have assembled, $C_i$ is the cost of the $i^{th}$ player, and $V$ is the amount of points we can \"spend\" to draft our fantasy team. \n",

An optimization like this would absolutely perform above average in a real set up - but the way I have chosen to set up the data neglects a lot of important covariances between players on opposing teams, and more importantly, some terms which would reward choosing players on the same line would be important. As This is set up for a very simple scoring system of 1 point per goal/assist for players, and 2 points for a goalie win, and 1 for a shut out, if we put similar lines together when possible we could gain more points by \"double diping\" the score/assist points in our fantasy line up. \n",

In thise case, we care a lot of we have the right number of players - if we choose poorly we will be very bad at fantasy hockey. However, if we choose players such that their points value is _less_ than our budget - that's actually okay - so this is a statement of attempting to punish those violations less severely when it works out well to use \"cheaper\" players. \n",
